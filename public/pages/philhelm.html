            <h2>Philhelm</h2>
            <p>Long ago, there was a mostly typical human kingdom that went by the name of Andriel. Isolated by mountains to
			the northwest and ocean to the southeast, their only contact with the world beyond their borders was from merchants
			from faraway lands. This isolation lead to little conflict, which lead to time for some folk to start experimenting
			with dark magicks. Despite innocent intentions, the demon Caizel was unleashed. Almost destroying the land, and driving
			off any merchants from returning, Caizel was only contained when 8 sorcerers set up a trap for the demon and contained
			it within Andriel's most righteous warrior,  Grrode. The demon now contained within Grrode, the people of Andriel could rebuild. </p>
			<p>They kept Grrode away from the battlefield in an attempt to prevent him from dying, for if he died, the demon would be released.
			However, he became lazy and selfish, his weakened moral conduct allowing the demon to begin manifesting. The manifestation was halted
			before it was too late, and the sorcerers realized that the chaotic evil Abyssspawn was being contained by the strong lawful good will
			of the warrior. </p>
			<p>From then on, a linage of noble warriors was kept separate from the rest of the peoples of Andriel, trained from birth to death in the
			ways of good and order, and bred for strength, both of character and of body. When a carrier of the demon was nearing death, the demon would
			be transferred into another warrior, and this continued for millennia. Over time, the truth of the demon and its containment was forgotten by
			all those but the mystics in charge of rearing the carriers, the King or Queen of Andriel, and the carrier himself. </p>
			<p>This chain was broken when the Andriel was rediscovered by sailors from distant lands. However, instead of trade being brought back to Andriel,
			war washed ashore instead. The people of Andriel were quickly overwhelmed by foreign forces, and in an attempt to protect the people of his kingdom,
			the carrier of Caizel was slain. The unleased demon quickly laid waste to all in its path, quickly ending conflict by killing everyone in Andriel and
			any foreign forces unlucky enough to cross its path. </p>
			<p>The last remaining sorcerer found the last remaining descendant of Grrode, Philhelm, a child of 10 at the time, and sacrificed his own life in an
			attempt to contain the demon. The containment was successful but fragile; a slip in alignment or significant injury or incapacitation on the part of
			Philhelm would be enough to partially release the demon, being able to be re-contained through the willpower of Philhelm. Philhelm's death would result
			in a full release, and much devastation would occur. </p>
			<p>The stress of the procedure would have certainly destroyed Philhelm, if not for the intervention of Sarenrae. He awoke to find an emissary of Sarenrae,
			a Rhamphorhynchus. Filled with strength and divine purpose, he set off to wander the lands and seek and destroy evil where he found it, as well as banish
			the demon Caizel before she could hurt others.</p>
			<p>Philhelm managed to flee with some of the survivors away from the ruins of Andriel, and vowed to find a way to vanquish Caizel. He traveled the world
			trying to find a satisfactory solution, when he met Professor Larimore at a bar. After taking the professor home after a night of hard drinking, and
			receiving an edible arrangements basket for his efforts , he became fast friends with the professor. When he discovered the nature of much of the professor's
			research, he let him know about Caizel and worked with him to try to find a way to banish Caizel back to the Abyss. </p>
