			<h2>Rök-Hir</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
            <p>The Abyss is inhabited by a variety of horrendous demons. All different shape and sizes, all inherently evil beings, and all have their place.
			Rök-Hir was of course no exception to this. Shadow demons are fairly strong demons on average, but Rök-Hir was a little less than average, the 
			runt of the litter as they say. As demon's do, he would occasionally pass into the Material Plane to wreak havoc, as little as he could with no 
			physical form. But as this brought no form of joy to his life, he was under the same misconception that many others have: that demons feel no emotions.
			But never knowing too happiness, this didn’t bother him too much, ash he didn’t know what he was missing. Until he met _.</p>
			<p>_ was a demon lord who took a particular liking to Rök-Hir, and it wasn't long until the two had what we can only compare to the demon equivalent
			to a romance. It was the only connection to another Rök-Hir had even felt, and he thoroughly enjoyed every minute with her, something he never even knew
			he could do. That was promptly put to an end, however, after the other Demon lords found out about this 'affair'. Demon Lords are the most powerful form of 
			demon, and do not pair with the lower sort. Rök-Hir was distraught, until he thought of the only possible solution. He too would have to become a demon lord.</p>
			<p>The Demon Lords are the most powerful beings in the plane, and the easiest way for him to become one was to defeat a Demon Lord and usurp its domain. So he
			trained himself against other demons, and traveled to the Material Plane to become stronger. Finally, after decades of training, Rök-Hir was at last able to face
			up against a Demon Lord, and after the thrilling battle that could only be described as epic, Rök-Hir came out completely and thoroughly defeated. </p>			
			<p>Near death, Rök-Hir knew that he would never become strong enough to rule any realm in the Abyss. And that’s when he realized what he must do. The Demon Lords, 
			were the strongest beings of the plane, and after training in the Material Plane so much and becoming familiar with the creatures and inhabitants there, he figured
			it wouldn't be hard to be the strongest being of that plane. He would become the sole demon Lord of the Material Plane, and his _ could live there in happiness, 
			smiting the mortals of the realm and ruling over them all. But as he had known, the non-material form of a shadow demon showed only a decent amount of power in 
			the material world. So in order to take over, he would need to acquire a material form. </p>
			<h2>Edith</h2>
			<p>On a mid-winter’s night, Kris Conti and Jim Thatcher journeyed from their village to a neighboring town. They did not return. Villagers later found their bodies
			eviscerated in the forest linking the two settlements. Along with one of the largest houses in the village and a fair amount of wealth, the two also left behind 
			their young nine year old daughter, Edith.</p>
			<p>The town elders took Edith into their home, albeit reluctantly, and provided her food and shelter. The entire town gave her empathy and pity for her loss, unable 
			to imagine the pain and sorrow she must have felt.  Edith, in fact, felt no sorrow or pain what so ever. All she felt was anger and hatred for whatever took her, and 
			she decided she wouldn’t sit still about it.</p>
			<p>She continued to feign sorrow amongst the townspeople, as their pity for her caused them to turn a blind eye to any odd behavior. With this deception, she spent most
			of her time in the village Library, convincing them that reading distracted her from her misery. She snuck her way to the restricted dark tomes that were stored away in
			the basement, and smuggled them out for her own use. If people couldn’t help her in her quest, then maybe the dead could. </p>
			<p>Using the Dark Texts, she tapped into the darker realms in search for her answers. Hoping black magic would tell her how her parents died, she went further and further
			into the arcane. Unfortunately, this left her vulnerable to the other plains, and allowed the demon Rök-Hir to enter her being. Now with a corporeal form, he could finally
			achieve his goal, except for one thorn in his plan. Her determination and resolve were too much, and her will power caused Rök-Hir to quickly lose control of Edith.
			Moreover, her will was so strong that he could no longer escape. </p>
			<p>For weeks, Edith kept Rök-Hir locked inside of her, with occasional battles for control, which Edith always won, even though they left her exhausted and drained. 
			This, in turn, caused the villagers to grow suspicious and concerned for Edith, and started to keep a close eye on her. Unfortunately, this made the task of discovering 
			what happened to her parents all the more difficult. </p>
			<p>Seeing an opportunity, Rök-Hir decided to make a deal with Edith: He would allow her to have control and use his demonic power to assist in her quest for vengeance,
			and in return she would allow him to occasionally take control and unleash chaos unto the Material Plane. Knowing then she could regain control from him if this was
			revealed to be a trick, she accepted the offer.</p>
			<h2>Roger</h2>
			<p>As a researcher into the creatures and dark magicks in the world, Professor Lorrimor was dedicated to keeping the people protected. Rumors started to erupt of a dark
			creature laying waste to a few small villages, and Petros saw it as his duty to do what he could to defeat it. He started his investigation and talked to survivors be for
			he tracked down what would probably be the creature’s next target. He went to this village, and used his expertise to track down the creature and put an end to its rampage.
			Upon finding the source of the dark magic in the area, however, the Professor was utterly shocked to discover who was causing all of the destruction: A small girl. </p>
			<p>Two months earlier, Edith and Rök-Hir made their pact with each other, and Edith tried to leave the village to start on her investigation into her parents deaths. 
			The forest was a dangerous place for a young girl to venture alone, but a young girl and a demon were just fine. The village elders didn’t see it that way, and as Edith tried
			to leave, they tried to forbid her from leaving. She could not convince them otherwise, so she allowed Rök-Hir to take control, assuming he’d scare them into listening at the very least. </p>
			<p>Edith awoke from blacking out, remembering nothing after she relinquished control of her body, but was glad to once again be in control. However, she was angered to find that the 
			elders had been killed in her absence, as well as many of the other villagers. She scolded Rök-Hir, who defended that not only was she not specific with her request of him, was also
			treated poorly by them these past few months, and sensed not care or compassion toward them. Edith realized this was true, and the elders were fairly awful to her, but was still
			angry at Rök-Hir for so quickly taking lives. He argued that when he is in control, she wasn’t going to be the one making that kind of decision. The deal was to allow him to create
			chaos, and that was his plan.</p>
			<p>Considering this, Edith asked if there was a way for them to share control, to be in constant communication with each other, and be able to call on his demonic powers when needed.
			So Rök-Hir agreed to this and they fused, acting now in cooperation. The duo started to leave the village, as many of the remaining villagers were now afraid of the demon that just
			attacked their village, mishearing his name as “Roger”. The two decided it would be best to leave before the rest of the town finally realized they could mob together, and so they set
			out for the other town.</p>
			<p>Entering the village, Edith headed to the town square to see if she could find out why her parents came to this town in the first place. However, it wasn’t long before the townsfolk
			also became concerned and tried to find her family. To avoid someone recognizing her and sending her back to the village, Edith adopted the name Roger to temporarily throw off the annoying
			citizens. </p>
			<p>The only lead she could find was that her mother had hidden her locket in the local inn, an heirloom she would never leave without. Knowing her mother to not be a forgetful person, Roger
			knew that the only explanation is she didn’t want someone to have it. What was more shocking was the locket was enchanted to be closed with light magic, and Roger could not even open it with
			dark magic.  Having some sort of lead now, Roger decided to leave. But the townsfolk tried to bring her to the orphanage, which was not acceptable. So Roger transformed into her demon form,
			allowing Edith to share control. They set fires to a few houses to allow enough distraction to escape. </p>
			<p>Two villages later, Roger was found by Lorrimor. Upon seeing she was a girl, He offered her stay in his estate with free food and bed, and in exchange allow him to research her bond with Rök-Hir.
			Upon hearing he was a professor, Edith knew he may have insight on magic, and Rök-Hir expected him to have tomes and texts on dark magic, and help him get stronger. Roger agreed to Petros’s offer,
			and travelled with him to his mansion.</p>
