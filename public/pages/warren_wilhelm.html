            <h2>Warren Wilhelm</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Early Life and Military Service</h3>
            <p>Warren Wilhelm (Originally spelled Warin) was born and raised in
                the land of Taldor, home of the legendary Crusaders. He claims
                to be a descendent of the famous generals Balrich and Reinhardt Wilhelm.</p>
            <p>Born into a middle class, and not showing any great aptitude for the academic,
                Warren (then Warin) was drafted into the service of the Taldorian military to
                 fight in his local duke's latest squabble. Warin became
                 increasingly disillusioned with the campagin. The final straw was
                 when the unit was marching through a village in Qadira. There he
                 met the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.</p>
           <p>Warin was disgusted with the Taldorian practice of taking innocent
               villiagers as prisoners, but he was somewhat glad that his superiors
               decided to take <a href="aya_cristallo.html">Aya Cristallo</a> as a
               prisoner. To Warin, she was beautiful, but he sensed a certain danger
               to her, a power even she could not contain. It frightened him but
               excited him. Being the rookie, he was assigned guard duty. He could
               not have been happier with the assignment.</p>
          <p>Warin and Aya bonded during their time together. The days bled to weeks,
              the weeks bled to months. Neither could tell for sure how long they
              were out trekking the Qadiran countryside, but it was long enough
              for them to fall in love.</p>
          <p> Each time this story is retold, a disagreement never fails to arise
              as to who's idea it was to make a break for it. Nevertheless, one spring
              day, Warin unlocked Aya's chains, forsook his <a href="../images/Falcata.jpg">Falcata</a>
              and made a run for it, deserting the Taldorian army and heading north.</p>
         <h3>The Masked Crusader and The Glass Sparrow</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>Deserting from the Taldorian army is punishable by death. Fortunatly
             for Warren and Aya, the Taldorian provences are signifigantly fractured
             that all they needed to evade detection was a mask and a few nicknames,
             provided they stayed far enough away from Warren's hometown.</p>
        <p>Warren and Aya wandered the countryside, ever heading to the Inner Sea.
            They didn't have much of a plan besides "get as far away from Taldor
            as possible". They worked as mercenaries, under the alias "The Masked Crusder"
            and "The Glass Sparrow", The former for his mask and suppoused heritage,
            the latter for her lean but powerful form and her incredible glasswork.
            Together, they provided bodyguard services, convoy escort services,
            and occasionally carried out assassinations when the money was good.</p>
        <p>Eventually they made their way up to Ustalav and found themselves travelling though
            Ravengrow, where they found the Professor Lorrimer pinned under a cart. Working
            together, Warren and Aya freed the professor and he insisted on bringing
            them back to his mansion to thank them. There they met his Protege, <a href="aiden_leonhard.html">Aiden Leonhard</a>
            and his, shall we say, "test subject", Roger.</p>
        <p>Warren and Aya accepted the professor's thanks in the form of a hot meal.
            On their way out, Aiden interrupted and begged Warren to teach him how to fight.
            He said he was on a quest to save his sister from an evil god and that
            he had learned all that he could from books and needed field experience.
            Warren sympathized with Aiden and agreed to take him on as a protege.</p>
        <h3>These Violent Delights...</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Warren, Aya, and Aiden headed east to the River Kingdoms to find work.
            The River Kingdoms, being the modern day equivalent of Australia, are
            always rife with work for mercenaries. About a month into their travels,
            they were offered an escort job. The price seemed too good to be true.
            Halfway through the mission, it became clear why the pay was so
            lucrative. The convoy was ambushed by a gang of mages.</p>
        <p>Mages as they were, they had a bit of difficulty casting spells with a
            hammer through their skulls. The battle looked to be handily in the
            favor of our heroes, until Aya took a magic missle to the face. As she
            fell to the ground, Warren rushed over, giving the mage he was fighting
            space to concentrate on another spell. Just as Warren got to his barely
            conscious partner, her body burst into purple flame.</p>
       <p>In his greif and rage, he barely noticed the pendant around his neck glow
           with a bright warm light, and then fade again. It was the last gift she
           ever gave him - a beautiful glass sparrow. Holding it up to the light
           never failed to produce a enchanting rainbow in all directions. It was
           the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, save Aya herself.</p>
      <p>Consumed by rage, he charged the nearest mage and nearly ripped his head
          clean off. He finally calmed down when the bloodied bodies of all the
          remaining mages lay at his feet. He walked back over to where Aya had
          fallen and found...nothing. Not even ash. Not even possessing the spirit to
          finish the job, he started walking back to Taldor, being as it was the
          only home he had ever known. Greieving was painful, walking was easy.</p>
     <h3>The Last Crusader and his Riven Blade</h3>
     <hr>
     <p>They were halfway through Galt when Aiden convinced Warren not to return
         to Taldor. He convinced Warren to return to Ustalav and meet up with the
         professor again. Warren agreed and they headed west. However, when they
         returned to Ustalav, they found the professor dead and a plot that goes
         back to the days of the first Crusaders...</p>
