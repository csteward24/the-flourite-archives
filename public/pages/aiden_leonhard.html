            <hr>
            <p>I come from the far off land of Anor Londo. My sister, Seraphine, and I were taken from our home town of Farron Keep at a very early age. Seraphine has no memories prior to the church and Anor Londo. Once we became of the right age the church started training us to be the guards of the cathedral. I practiced in a high dexterity class of weapons under the Pontiff Sulyvahn. One night, while sneaking through the cathedral, I saw something that I wasn't meant to see. Aldrich, my god, consuming a man brought to him by the Pontiff. I was spotted and had to run. Back at my living quarters I grabbed a bag, packed it with some weapons, clothes and money, and I ran as fast as I could.
From then on it has been my goal to learn about magic, and how to fight it so I may return to the cathedral and rescue my sister. I traveled the land looking for someone to teach me about magic.
Upon finding the professor I asked for him to teach me, and after telling him my tale he agreed. Underneath the watch of the professor I had extensive times of exposure with <a href="roger.html">Roger</a>. I don't know exactly how she feels about me, but I think we're have a mutual respect for each other. I think of her as my own kin. During my studies I came into contact with <a href="warren_wilhelm.html">Warren Wilhelm</a>. Warren took me under his wing and taught me all he knew. After surpassing his teaching and excelling in all fields he taught me and now we interact as equals.
I hope to soon return to Anor Londo to save my sister... My only fear is that she turns hallow before I return.</p>
