            <h2>The Whispering Way</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The Whispering Way is a sinister
organization of necromancers that has been active in the
Inner Sea region for thousands of years.</p>
            <p>Agents of the Whispering Way often
seek alliances with undead creatures, or are themselves
undead. The Whispering Wayâ€™s most notorious member
was Tar-Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant, although the
society itself has existed much longer than even that
mighty necromancer.<p>
